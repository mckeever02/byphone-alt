&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all given an extension number and a personal voicemail box connected to our email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main number didn’t have to change and was connected to the new hosted PBX via an auto attendant that re-directs incoming calls and, if unanswered, voicemail is emailed to the team member called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When customers call they hear a friendly greeting and can choose between a specific department (copywriting, graphics, accounts), an employee&amp;rsquo;s extension or leave a voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can see who&amp;rsquo;s calling and can transfer callers to colleagues and even host conference calls. Whenever a customer calls the graphics department both mobiles ring simultaneously (ring-all) and whoever is available first can answer the call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We got the teams’ communications unified as had been the original objective and with the added benefit of significant telecoms cost savings..&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><category term="case-studies" /><summary>Many small office/home office (SoHo) based businesses don’t have or use a landline and instead prefer to use mobile phones. This works for making calls (outbound calls) but then which of these mobile numbers is then the main business number to be handed out for taking calls (inbound calls).</summary></entry><entry><title>National mobility</title><link href="http://helloiammichael.com/national-mobility-case-study/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="National mobility" /><published>2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://helloiammichael.com/national-mobility-case-study</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://helloiammichael.com/national-mobility-case-study/"></content><category term="case-studies" /><summary>With Byphone you are not tied geographically.
