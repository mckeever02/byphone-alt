      <p>1.1 ByPhone may route your calls over any carrier or carriers that it may choose for the provision of the Service.

<p>1.4 ByPhone Limited services are all able to connect 999/112 emergency calls. Location information received by the emergency services will be limited to the Premises at which your telephone line is connected. This may not necessarily be the same location as that where the call is made. A power failure or a broadband connection, interruption or failure may mean that an emergency call will fail. You should ensure you have alternative arrangements e.g. an analogue line with an unpowered handset or a mobile phone for emergency calls.</p>
